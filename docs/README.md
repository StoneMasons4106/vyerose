# VyeRose

This project is meant to provide an online store for the small local business, VyeRose.

VyeRose is a small singularly owned jewelry business based in Tonawanda, NY. This project gives VyeRose an online platform to advertise their products, and for customers to purchase them, create accounts, edit delivery information, and provide quick contact with the business owner.

[Feel free to view the live project here](https://vyerose.herokuapp.com)!

## UX

This site is designed to give the user a visually pleasing way to browse products for the VyeRose online store.

For inspiration, I looked at a number of [Bootstrap Templates](https://bootstrapmade.com/) to get a beautiful front end design. In the end, I settled on using the [MeFamily](https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/MeFamily/).

#### User Stories:

* First Time Visitor Goals:
    * Easily understand the purpose of the site.
    * Quickly learn how to navigate the site and make sure it is intuitively accessible for first time users.
    * Visually appealing to have a pleasant first experience.
    * Be able to quickly browse products to quickly determine interest.
    * Be able to contact the owner of the store if I have any questions.

* Returning Visitor Goals:
    * Be able to login/register so information can be saved, and chekout is expedient.
    * Be able to login with my Google account so creating an account is painless.
    * Have items that I my have in my cart still be there when I return.

* Frequent User Goals:
    * Be able to save my delivery information so that I don't have to re-enter every time I order.
    * See my order history to see what I have already bought.
    * Have the option to custom order if I want to change something to a particular product.
